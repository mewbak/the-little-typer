## Exercises

This repository contains [exercises](exercises/) for material in the book. We discussed solutions to the exericses in the study sessions. Example solutions to the exercises are given in the repository, they are the files with the `-crib` prefix.

The book states that "An understanding of recursive functions over non-nested lists and non-negative numbers is all you need to understand this book". The exercises in [recursion.rkt](exercises/recursion.rkt) aims to provide you with the prerequisite knowledge. These exercises were taken from _The Little Schemer_ book.

The remaining exercises are numbered according to the chapter they correspond to. For example exercise `8.2` assumes that you've read up to chapter 8 of _The Little Typer_

### Acknowledgments

Exercise sets `3.x`, `4.x` and `5.x` were adapted from exercise sheets from a course at Indiana University. All subsequent exercises were compiled by Paul Cadman.
